## week 1: 
we went over the module plan, installed node for the first time, created my erd, got it approved, started following the tutorials set out by anne, i used laravel to create the model, migration, routes, controller and seeder. The route in web.php tells the programme where to get the different parts of the code from, in the simplest terms its a set of directions for the code to follow. Index shows everything, create shows the form for adding a new album, store saves it edit pulls up the edditing form update is like store for the edit route, and destroy is pretty self explanatory. you can also use a powershell command to view the routes. the controller is pretty much used to compile all the routes into one class. Its also notable that you make these with a php artisan command although you have to be very careful with the naming scheme. The views simply show the html and data so basically they are what the user sees while going through the website.

## week 2:
continuing work with tutorials, some bugs were encountered along the way, howeever with some help from my classmates and the lecturers i got a lot of the CRUD system sorted. Show was working flawlessly and i had a few hiccups working on create innitially but then i just kinda browsed through my project that i made for webdev last year. update was a bit more finicky but in the end i got that sorted, and delete was as simple as it gets. 

## week 3: 
most of the work is finished i just need to figure out styling, 
stylign was figured out, i forgot to run node which was causing a mountain of problems but in the end we got there and the websites looking nice.

## week 4: 
Started working on the extra option, i decided to embed the tracklist from the album into the album details page, i got my extra working and now you can embed the tracklists from the albums into the views.
